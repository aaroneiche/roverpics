# roverpics
A Simple Java program that fetches a data set of Rover pictures using NASA's API.

This program uses NASA's public [_Mars Rover Photos_ API_](https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#MarsPhotos)

The program was written as an assigned exercise for my BYU Idaho CS course "Software Design and Development"
It's posted here for the benefit of the class who may be unfamiliar working with APIs other than Twitter's which 
was the default assignment.

If you're using IntelliJ, import the project.
